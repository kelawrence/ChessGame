This is a personal project to create a chess engine that will eventually allow the user to play against an AI.

This is a work in progress to allow me to learn more about Java and get used to using Git and to practice writing better 
comments for my code.

Currently woring on the individual classes for the pieces with only the King and the Pawn left to do.

Once the pieces are complete, I will work on the Board class and then complete the Move class so only legal moves are allowed.
